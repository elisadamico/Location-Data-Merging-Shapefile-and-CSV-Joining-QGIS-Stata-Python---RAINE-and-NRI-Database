# Location-Data-Merging-Shapefile-and-CSV-Joining-QGIS-Stata-Python---RAINE-and-NRI-Database

This project focuses on merging location-based data from the RAINE and NRI databases using a combination of QGIS, Python, and Stata. The initial task involved merging a shapefile with a CSV attribute-only table, where the CSV lacked mappable data but contained state and county variables that could be utilized for joining.

To accomplish this, I harnessed the spatial processing capabilities of QGIS and employed Python scripting to merge the shapefile and CSV based on the state and county variables. This approach enabled the creation of a combined dataset with spatial attributes, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis.

Throughout the process, I ensured that all data files, including the initial shapefile, CSV, and the merged dataset, were carefully organized and saved within the project repository. This practice guarantees easy access to the data and promotes reproducibility.

Following the merging of data in QGIS, I transitioned to Stata to perform essential data cleaning and formatting tasks. Leveraging the powerful tools and functions offered by Stata, I executed various operations to refine the merged dataset, ensuring its quality and consistency.

By leveraging the strengths of QGIS, Python, and Stata, I successfully merged the initial data, incorporated spatial attributes, and meticulously cleaned and formatted the merged dataset. This comprehensive approach has resulted in a final dataset that is ready for further analysis or visualization, providing valuable insights into the combined location-based data from the RAINE and NRI databases.
